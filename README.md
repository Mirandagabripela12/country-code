# Country Code

Country Code is an Android app that provides quick information about 200+ countries. It was
created because of I was looking for an offline database with phone prefixes and I couldn't find
one that I felt fully comfortable with.

## Information displayed
* Country Phone Prefix
* Capital City
* Currency (useful for travelers)
* Timezone offset
* ISO Alpha 2 Code

## Special thanks to
